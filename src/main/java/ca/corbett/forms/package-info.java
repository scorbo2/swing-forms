/**
 * This is a simple Java Swing forms library that I wrote back in 2019 or
 * so for use in various projects. Provides a way to very easily generate
 * basic form panels with optional validation rules without having to write
 * a bunch of GridBagLayout code, which I hate.
 * <p>
 * For example usage and capabilities, look at the included demo application.
 * This jar file itself is executable and will launch the demo application
 * when run.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Using only the included FormField implementation in the "fields" package
 * and the example FieldValidator implementations in the "validators" package,
 * you can create reasonably complex forms quite easily, without ever
 * having to write manual layout code with GridBagLayout.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * But perhaps the real advantage of this library is that both FormField
 * and FieldValidator are highly extensible, meaning you can create your
 * own FormFields and your own form validation rules reasonably quickly.
 * </p>
